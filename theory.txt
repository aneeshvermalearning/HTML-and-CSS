INTRODUCTION

Everyone's css is different.

Can be extended with Sass/Less to programming logic like variables.

3 methods: inline(horrible practice to use this..should keep different..separate style from presentation),
internal(cannot use that css anywhere else) and external

type="text/css" not required from HTML 4 in link tag.

CSS syntax
selector => declaration start => property => property/value separator => value => declaration separator 
=> declaration end.

a{
    background-color:yellow;
}

a(selector){(declaration start)
    background-color(property):(property/value separator ) yellow(value);(declaration separator)
}(declaration end)

COLORS IN CSS

Colors values which can be used:
1. color names.....eg red,green
2. HTML5 color names .....eg coral, mistyrose
3. Hexadecimal.....eg #00ff00....#000000 is black...#ffffff is white
    Can use shortcut.. use 3 instead of 6 for some colors
4. RGB(red green blue).....eg rgb(0,0,255)
    RGB black => rgb(0,0,0)
    RGB white => rgb(255,255,255)

FONTS

font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
=> Load Arial, if for some reason Arial cannot load then Helvetica, if cannot Helvetica then 
basic sans-serif which is also the type of font.

In CSS you have 2 types of fonts:
1. websafe fonts => no need to import anything like Arial.
* Times new Roman is default.
* 5 types of basic fonts:
    1. serif fonts have hooks to them..check assets/TYPEFACE.gif
        Serif fonts include Times Roman, Courier, New Century Schoolbook, and Palatino.
    2. sans-serif is kind of a flat look...check assets/TYPEFACE.gif. 
        Popular sans serif fonts include Helvetica, Avant Garde, Arial, and Geneva
    3. monospace => fixed-width fonts
    4. cursive =>  fonts that emulate handwriting 
    5. fantasy =>  decorative fonts, for titles, etc.
2. other fonts => have to import like from bootstrap


Default font size = 16 px

Basic Font css =>
font-size,font-weight, font-family

We can use these properties indivually or in one line 

ONE LINE:
font: 16px normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
/*
Can rearrange.. just make sure this doesnt happen=>
                
                font: 16px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif normal;
*/

. line-height:1.6 em
/* 
    em stands for “emphemeral unit”...just a unit. for responsive sites..used mostly in line height  
    Originally, the em was equal to the width of the capital
    letter M, which is where its name originated.”

    Em is basically the font size relative to the font size of the parent elements. If the font size of your body tag would be 12px, then if you define a font size of 2em to a h1 tag. This font size would be 24px.
